# Overview
Ha.BIT is a gamified productivity app designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently while having fun. By completing tasks and engaging with various levels, users earn coins that can be spent in the in-app shop to customize their characters.

## Problem
Many people struggle with productivity and task management due to a lack of motivation and engagement. Traditional to-do lists and productivity tools often fail to provide the necessary incentives to keep users on track. Ha.BIT addresses this pain point by incorporating gamification elements that make task management enjoyable and rewarding.
